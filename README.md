# General Calculator App

A simple web-based calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) between two numbers.

## Features

* User-friendly interface with clean styling.
* Supports four operations:

  * Addition (+)
  * Subtraction (-)
  * Multiplication (×)
  * Division (÷)
* Input validation with error messages for invalid numbers or missing operator.
* Results are displayed clearly with styled success/error messages.

## Project Structure

```
.
├── index.html     # Main HTML structure for the app
├── app.js         # JavaScript logic for calculations and validation
└── styles.css     # CSS styles for layout and design
```

## How It Works

1. Enter the first number in the first input field.
2. Select an operator from the dropdown menu.
3. Enter the second number in the second input field.
4. Click the **Submit** button.
5. The result will be displayed below the form.

If invalid input is entered (like text, empty fields, or missing operator), the app will show an error message in red. Valid results appear in green.
